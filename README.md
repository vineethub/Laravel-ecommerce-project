# Laravel & Redis E-commerce Project

This is a modern e-commerce web application built with Laravel 11 and powered by Redis. The project serves as a practical learning exercise to demonstrate core e-commerce functionalities and best practices in a real-world application.

## Project Status: Core Functionality Complete

The application now has a complete, end-to-end transaction flow and a full suite of user account management features. The foundational engine of the e-commerce store is built and fully functional.

### Completed Features (âœ…)
*   **Full E-commerce Transaction Flow:**
    *   Product Catalog, Redis-Powered Shopping Cart, Multi-Step Checkout, Stripe Payment Integration, and an Order Management System.
*   **Complete User Account Management:**
    *   User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout).
    *   User Dashboard, Order History, and full Account Settings.
*   **Functional Admin Panel:**
    *   A secure, role-protected admin area.
    *   Full CRUD for managing **Product Categories**, **Products**, and **Coupon Codes**.
    *   A complete **Order Management** system to view orders and update their status.
    *   An interface to manage customer **Return Requests**.
*   **Advanced Customer Features:**
    *   A complete **Shopping Cart** with add, view, update, and remove functionality.
    *   A **Customer Review & Rating** system for products.
    *   The ability for customers to **apply coupons** in the cart.
    *   A complete **Return/Refund System** allowing customers to request returns for completed orders.

### Next Steps (ðŸš€)
The core application is now feature-complete. The final phase of development will focus on external integration.

1.  **Build a RESTful API:** Expose the application's data and functionality through a secure, token-based API using Laravel Sanctum. This will enable the development of other clients, such as:
    *   A native mobile application (iOS/Android).
    *   A headless frontend built with a framework like Next.js or Vue.js.
