# Laravel & Redis E-commerce Project

This is a modern e-commerce web application built with Laravel 11 and powered by Redis. The project serves as a practical learning exercise to demonstrate core e-commerce functionalities and best practices in a real-world application.

## Project Status: Core Functionality Complete

The application now has a complete, end-to-end transaction flow and a full suite of user account management features. The foundational engine of the e-commerce store is built and fully functional.

### Completed Features (âœ…)
*   **Full E-commerce Transaction Flow:**
    *   Product Catalog, Redis-Powered Shopping Cart, Multi-Step Checkout, Stripe Payment Integration, and an Order Management System.
*   **Complete User Account Management:**
    *   User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout).
    *   User Dashboard with account overview.
    *   Detailed Order History page.
    *   Full Account Settings (Profile info and secure password updates).
*   **Robust Authorization System:**
    *   Implemented a powerful roles and permissions system using `spatie/laravel-permission`.
    *   Created `Super-Admin`, `Admin`, and `Customer` roles with granular permissions.

### Next Steps (ðŸš€)
With a secure authorization system in place, the immediate next step is to build the Admin Panel itself.

1.  **Build Admin Panel:** Create a secure area for administrators to manage the store.
2.  **Category CRUD:** The first feature within the admin panel will be to Create, Read, Update, and Delete product categories.
3.  **Product Search & Filtering:** Implement a search bar and advanced filtering options.
4.  **Build a RESTful API:** Create API endpoints for use with other applications (e.g., a mobile app).
