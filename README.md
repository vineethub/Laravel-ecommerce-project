# Laravel & Redis E-commerce Project

This is a modern e-commerce web application built with Laravel 11 and powered by Redis. The project serves as a practical learning exercise to demonstrate core e-commerce functionalities and the effective use of Redis for high-performance features like caching and session management.

## Project Status: In Development

The project is actively under development. The core foundation is complete, and we are currently building out the main e-commerce transaction features.

### Completed Features (âœ…)
*   **Product Catalog:** Users can browse a grid of products and view individual product detail pages.
*   **User Authentication:** A complete, custom-built authentication system allows users to register, log in, and log out. Routes are protected with middleware.
*   **Redis-Powered Shopping Cart:**
    *   A high-performance shopping cart using Redis Hashes.
    *   Supports both guest and authenticated user carts.
    *   Guest carts are seamlessly merged into user accounts upon login.
*   **Git Version Control:** The codebase is version-controlled and hosted on GitHub.

### Current Work-in-Progress (ðŸš§)
*   **Checkout Flow:** Building the pages and logic for users to enter shipping information.

### Next Steps (ðŸš€)
1.  **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate Stripe to handle secure online payments.
2.  **Order Management System:** Create a system to store permanent order records in the main SQL database.
3.  **User Dashboard:** Develop a dashboard for users to view their order history and manage their profiles.
4.  **Admin Panel:** Create a backend interface for store administrators to manage products and orders.

## Tech Stack
*   **Backend:** Laravel 11 (PHP)
*   **Database:** MySQL (for permanent data like users, products, orders)
*   **In-Memory Store:** Redis (for caching, shopping carts, and session management)
*   **Frontend:** Tailwind CSS
