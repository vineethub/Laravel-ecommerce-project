# Laravel & Redis E-commerce Project

This is a modern e-commerce web application built with Laravel 11 and powered by Redis. The project serves as a practical learning exercise to demonstrate core e-commerce functionalities and best practices in a real-world application.

## Project Status: Core Functionality Complete

The application now has a complete, end-to-end transaction flow and a full suite of user account management features. The foundational engine of the e-commerce store is built and fully functional.
